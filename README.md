# Hugging-Face-Dataset-Toolkit

This repository contains a set of tools and scripts to help you work with datasets from the Hugging Face ecosystem. The main focus is on preprocessing and analyzing the datasets before using them in your machine learning projects.

## Overview

The repository currently includes the following components:

1. **hf_toolkit.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to:
   - Read and process a dataset from a JSON file
   - Remove sentences without any annotations
   - Write the processed data back to a file
   - Count the unique labels and their occurrences in the dataset

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Hugging-Face-Dataset-Toolkit.git
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook `hf_toolkit.ipynb` and follow the instructions in the notebook.

3. Customize the script to fit your specific dataset and requirements.
